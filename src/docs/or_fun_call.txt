### What it does
Checks for calls to `.or(foo(..))`, `.unwrap_or(foo(..))`,
etc., and suggests to use `or_else`, `unwrap_or_else`, etc., or
`unwrap_or_default` instead.

### Why is this bad?
The function will always be called and potentially
allocate an object acting as the default.

### Known problems
If the function has side-effects, not calling it will
change the semantic of the program, but you shouldn't rely on that anyway.

### Example
```
foo.unwrap_or(String::new());
```

Use instead:
```
foo.unwrap_or_else(String::new);

// or

foo.unwrap_or_default();
```
